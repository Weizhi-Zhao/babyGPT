    The text is in Chinese and appears to be discussing electrical engineering concepts,
    specifically related to three-phase bridge rectifiers and their control methods.

    of a three-phase bridge rectifier circuit. The text is technical and includes
    mathematical expressions and references to electrical components and control signals.


    Here is a rough translation of the text:


    "图 7-7 是三相桥式PWM逆变电路，这种电路都是采用双极性控制方式。U、V和W三相的PWM控制通常共用一个三角波载波u_c，三相的调制信号u_u、u_v和u_w依次相差120°。

    U、V和W各相功率开关器件的控制规律相同，现以U相为例来说明。当u_u > u_c时，给上桥臂V1以导通信号，给下桥臂V4以关断信号，则U相相对于直流电源假想中点N''的输出电压u_uN''
    = U_c/2。当u_u < u_c时，给V1以导通信号，给V4以关断信号，则u_uN'' = -U_c/2。

    V1和V4的驱动信号始终是互补的。当给V1(V4)加导通信号时，可能是V1(V4)导通，也可能是二极管VD1(VD4)续流导通，这要由阻感负载中电流的方向来决定，这和单相桥式PWM逆变电路在双极性控制时的情况相同。V相及W相的控制方式都和U相相同。电路的"


    The text discusses the control of three-phase bridge rectifiers using PWM (Pulse
    Width Modulation) and mentions the use of triangular wave carriers and the relationship
    between the control signals and the output voltage. It also talks about the complementary
    nature of the drive signals for the switches and the role of diodes in the circuit.
    The text concludes by stating that the control methods for V and W phases are
    the same as for U phase, and the circuit''s behavior in double-polarity control
    is similar to that in single-phase bridge circuits.</s>'

- caption: '<s>The image is a bar and line graph titled "历年《公安机关立案的杀人刑事案件》（1995-2021）"
    which translates to "Annual Homicide Criminal Cases Initiated by Public Security
    Authorities (1995-2021)." The graph is divided into two main sections: a bar graph
    on the left and a line graph on the right.


    ### Bar Graph:

    - The x-axis represents the years from 1995 to 2021.

    - The y-axis on the left side of the bar graph measures the number of cases, ranging
    from 0.0 to 3.0 million.

    - Each year is represented by a bar, and the height of the bar indicates the number
    of cases for that year.

    - The bars are color-coded in shades of blue and pink, with the blue bars representing
    the number of cases and the pink bars representing the proportion of cases per
    million people.


    ### Line Graph:

    - The x-axis is the same as the bar graph, representing the years from 1995 to
    2021.

    - The y-axis on the right side of the line graph measures the proportion of cases
    per million people, ranging from 0.0 to 24.0 million.

    - A line graph is plotted on top of the bar graph, showing the proportion of cases
    per million people for each year.

    - The line is color-coded in green.


    ### Data Points:

    - The highest number of cases is around 2.7 million in 1995.

    - The number of cases decreases over the years, with a significant drop around
    2005.

    - The proportion of cases per million people also decreases over the years, with
    the highest proportion around 24.0 million in 1995 and the lowest around 4.8 million
    in 2020.


    ### Additional Information:

    - The data source is mentioned as "国家统计局历年《公安机关立案的杀人刑事案件》（1995-2021）" which translates
    to "National Bureau of Statistics Annual Homicide Criminal Cases Initiated by
    Public Security Authorities (1995-2021)."

    - The graph is annotated with Chinese text, providing context and details about
    the data.


    ### Analysis:

    The graph shows a clear downward trend in both the number of homicide cases and
    the proportion of cases per million people from 1995 to 2021. This suggests a
    general decline in the incidence of homicide over the years. The drop in cases
    is particularly noticeable around 2005, indicating a significant change in the
    crime rate during that period. The proportion of cases per million people also
    decreases, which could imply improvements in public safety measures, changes in
    law enforcement practices, or other societal factors contributing to the reduction
    in homicide rates.</s>'
